Overview of research for completion of Masters in Geology.

My research is a field-based outcrop study of the Point Loma Fm. in San Diego, CA.
Here, I am measuring the lateral variability of thin bedded turbidite deposits.

This work is important because understanding whether or not facies change predictably in such deposits can impact reservoir modeling and ultimate estimates for hydrocarbon recovery.
